## Development Workflow

### Feature Branch Process

#### Run the Sync Script Before Starting Development

Before starting any new feature or development work, ensure your local environment is clean and synced with the latest `main` branch using the `sync-branches.sh` script. This script helps you:

- **Clean Up Old Feature Branches**:
   - Deletes all local branches prefixed with `feature/` to avoid clutter or conflicts.
- **Sync with Remote**:
   - Ensures your local `main` branch is updated with the latest changes from the remote repository.

#### How to Run the Script

To run the script:

1. Ensure the script is executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x tools/sync-branches.sh
    ```
2. Run the script from anywhere in your project directory:
    ```sh
    ./tools/sync-branches.sh
    ```
    If youâ€™ve added the `tools` folder to your `$PATH`, you can run it simply as:
    ```sh
    sync-branches.sh
    ```

The script performs the following steps:
- Deletes all local branches prefixed with `feature/`.
- Updates the `main` branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
- Ensures your working environment is clean and ready to create a new feature branch.

### Feature Branch Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
    - Create a new branch from `main` for your feature.
    - Use a descriptive name for your branch, e.g., `feature/add-new-feature`.

2. **Make Changes Locally**:
    - Implement the feature or fix in your local environment.
    - Regularly commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
    - Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes all local tests.

3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
    - Commit your changes to the feature branch and push them to the remote repository:
       ```sh
       git add .
       git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
       git push origin feature/add-new-feature
       ```

4. **Create a Pull Request to `development`**:
    - Create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `development` branch.
    - This triggers the CI/CD pipeline to run linting, build, and unit tests.
    - If the tests pass, the changes are deployed to the development environment for integration testing.

5. **Integration Testing**:
    - Once the changes are deployed to the development environment, perform integration testing to ensure everything works as expected.

6. **Create a Pull Request to `main`**:
    - After successful integration testing, create a pull request from `development` to `main`.
    - This triggers the CI/CD pipeline to run linting, build, unit tests, and integration tests.
    - If all tests pass, the changes are deployed to the production environment.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions and includes the following jobs:

1. **Lint**:
    - Checks code style and formatting using `flake8`.

2. **Build**:
    - Builds the project after the lint job completes successfully.
    - Uses the `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from GitHub Secrets.

3. **Test**:
    - Runs unit tests after the build job completes successfully.
    - Uses the `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables from GitHub Secrets.

4. **Deploy to Development Environment**:
    - Deploys to the development environment when there is a push to the `development` branch or a pull request targeting the `development` branch.
    - Uses the `RENDER_DEV_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` environment variable from GitHub Secrets.

5. **Integration Test**:
    - Runs integration tests on the deployed development environment.
    - Runs only if the `deploy-dev` job completes successfully.

6. **Deploy to Production Environment**:
    - Deploys to the production environment when there is a push to the `main` branch or a pull request targeting the `main` branch.
    - Uses the `RENDER_PROD_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` environment variable from GitHub Secrets.

## Release and Naming Conventions

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/your-feature-name`
- **Development Branch**: `development`
- **Main Branch**: `main`

### Commit Message Prefixes

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Identifying Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Include this in the commit message to indicate a breaking change.

Example:
```sh
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature BREAKING CHANGE: This change will break the existing API"
```


3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   - Commit your changes to the feature branch and push them to the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
     git push origin feature/add-new-feature
     ```

4. **Create a Pull Request to `development`**:
   - Create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `development` branch.
   - This triggers the CI/CD pipeline to run linting, build, and unit tests.
   - If the tests pass, the changes are deployed to the development environment for integration testing.

6. **Create a Pull Request to `main`**:
